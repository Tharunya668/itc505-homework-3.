  <b><u>Explanation of Font Delivery Process: </u> </b>
    <li> This is a paragraph of text with the "kablammo" font style. <li>
    In this assignment, I'm delivering a custom font to the client's browser by using Google Fonts.
    <li>  I visited the Google Fonts website (https://fonts.google.com/).</li>
    <li>  I selected the "kablammo" font, which is not typically present on most computers.</li>
    <li> I obtained a link to the font in the "Embed Font" section of Google Fonts.</li>
    <li> I linked to the font in my HTML by adding the following link tag:
      <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=kablammo&display=swap"&gt;</code>
    <li> In my CSS file (style.css), I applied the "kablammo" font to various elements.</li>
    <li> The font does not look conventional, but it's readable and noticeable.</li> </ol>

    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>"Serving fonts" refers to the process of making web fonts available to web browsers so that they can be displayed correctly on websites. Web fonts are custom fonts that are not installed on the user's computer but are instead downloaded by the web browser when a user visits a website. Serving fonts involves several steps:
<ol>
<li><b>Font File Formats:</b> Web fonts are typically provided in various file formats, such as TrueType (TTF), OpenType (OTF), Web Open Font Format (WOFF), and Web Open Font Format 2 (WOFF2). These different formats ensure compatibility with various web browsers.</li>

<li><b>Font Hosting:</b> Web fonts need to be hosted on a server accessible via the internet. Website owners can host fonts on their own servers or use third-party font hosting services. Many font foundries and services offer web font hosting to simplify the process.</li>

<li><b>CSS Integration:</b> To use web fonts on a website, you need to include CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that specifies the font family and where to retrieve the font files. This CSS is typically added to the website's stylesheet.</li>

<li><b>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): </b>If the font files are hosted on a different domain than the website, you may need to configure CORS settings to allow web browsers to fetch the font files from a different origin.</li>

<li><b>Fallback Fonts:</b> It's a good practice to specify fallback fonts in your CSS in case the web font doesn't load for some reason. This ensures that the text remains readable even if the custom font is unavailable.</li>
<li><b>Optimization:</b> To improve website performance, font files can be optimized for the web, ensuring they are compressed and efficiently delivered to users. Font files can be quite large, so optimizing them can reduce page load times.</li>

<li><b>Testing:</b> It's essential to test the fonts on various browsers and devices to ensure they display correctly and maintain readability.</li>

<li><b>Licensing:</b> Ensure that you have the proper licensing for the web fonts you are using. Some fonts may require specific licensing agreements for web use.</li>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
Serving fonts correctly is important for web design and branding, as it allows websites to maintain a consistent visual identity by using custom fonts that are not limited to the fonts installed on users' devices.
